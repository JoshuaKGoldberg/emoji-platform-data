- [#1035](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/pull/1035) [`c373f9e`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/commit/c373f9e2def8f0b7e7bd41d82871b9151e4201b1) Thanks [@JoshuaKGoldberg](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg)! - Added 🤵‍♂️ and 👯, which were dropped because Emojipedia titles them the same as 🤵 and 👯‍♀️.

- [#1039](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/pull/1039) [`b54fbef`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/commit/b54fbefd7ee77cdde2018cfddfd9317890b000de) Thanks [@JoshuaKGoldberg](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg)! - Fixed 🧕 being split across two entries, one keyed by Emojipedia's non-standard 🧕‍♀️, by keying emoji by the glyph platforms know them by when Emojipedia's matches none of them.

### Patch Changes

- [#1018](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/pull/1018) [`90e6925`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/commit/90e692568ac90a8cca92468d7ab8b4823922dcb4) Thanks [@JoshuaKGoldberg](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg)! - Titled 🦰, 🦱, and 🦲 by their names, `Red Hair`, `Curly Hair`, and `Bald`, rather than by their code points, now that JoyPixels names them: `byTitle.U_1F9B2` is now `byTitle.Bald`.

- [#1017](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/pull/1017) [`52a7b69`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/commit/52a7b69af379fe6d35197a3f1c4975720fbe6e66) Thanks [@JoshuaKGoldberg](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg)! - Fixed the build failing on Slack's emoji, and merged emoji that platforms title two ways under different slugs, such as 🇨🇶, which `byEmoji` could only reach one of.

- [#1014](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/pull/1014) [`ffaedaa`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/commit/ffaedaac44d0a525681386d1301198c99eb5cf88) Thanks [@JoshuaKGoldberg](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg)! - Fixed `emoji-platform-data` and `@emoji-platform-data/wechat` throwing a SyntaxError on import, by merging emoji that platforms title two ways and titling WeChat-only emoji by their code points.
