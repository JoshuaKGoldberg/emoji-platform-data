### Patch Changes

- [#1035](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/pull/1035) [`c373f9e`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/commit/c373f9e2def8f0b7e7bd41d82871b9151e4201b1) Thanks [@JoshuaKGoldberg](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg)! - Added 🤵‍♂️ and 👯, which were dropped because Emojipedia titles them the same as 🤵 and 👯‍♀️.

- [#1039](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/pull/1039) [`b54fbef`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-platform-data/commit/b54fbefd7ee77cdde2018cfddfd9317890b000de) Thanks [@JoshuaKGoldberg](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg)! - Fixed 🧕 being split across two entries, one keyed by Emojipedia's non-standard 🧕‍♀️, by keying emoji by the glyph platforms know them by when Emojipedia's matches none of them.
